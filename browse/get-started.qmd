---

R-universe serves as your gateway to discovering a wide variety of R packages.  
R-universe is a collection of **universes**, each representing the packages maintained by an individual or team.  
R-universe [continuously updates](#data-updates) its data on packages.

You can search for packages and evaluate them using the detailed information provided on universe and package pages.  
Explore the three levels of navigation within R-universe:

- [Search the entire R ecosystem](/browse/search.html)
- [Browse work from a specific maintainer or organization](/browse/universes.html)
- [Access detailed information about individual packages](/browse/packages.html)

:::{.callout-caution}
R-universe does not vet packages; it is an open publishing system. 
The platform builds and deploys R packages from Git repositories into installation repositories.  
The responsibility for policies and quality control lies solely with the owner of each universe.
