title: "Browsing work from a maintainer or organization"
---

Each user and organization in R-universe has a unique subdomain under r-universe.dev with a package repository from where packages can directly be installed. 
For example, the packages and information from rOpenSci can be found on https://ropensci.r-universe.dev, and packages maintained by Jeroen Ooms are listed at https://jeroen.r-universe.dev (note how these two sets overlap).

The top tabs allow you to explore different resources within universe. 

![Builds tab of an universe](../img/univ-builds.png){group="univ" fig-alt="Builds tab of an universe, including a summary table of package versions and the status of latest builds on different OS."}

The builds tab shows the current state of the repository: a table with the name and version of each package, including the commit date, author, and build status. 
Clicking on the package name in the table sends you to the [homepage of the package](/browse/packages.html), and the maintainer name links to the subdomain of that maintainer, listing other projects maintained by this person.

![Packages tab of an universe](../img/univ-packages.png){group="univ" fig-alt="Packages tab of an universe, showing one summary card per package."}

![Articles tab of an universe](../img/univ-articles.png){group="univ" fig-alt="Articles tab of an universe, showing all vignettes."}

The packages tab lists descriptive information from all packages in the repository, and the articles tab shows all documents (e.g. vignettes). 

![Contributors tab of an universe](../img/univ-contributors.png){group="univ" fig-alt="Contributors tab of an universe, showing contribution activity per contributor."}

The contributors tab shows a chart with contributor statistics for the organization or maintainer.
Clicking on the a bar in the chart sends you to this other universe where you can explore more work by this person.

The same subdomain hosts the actual cran-like package repository for this user or organization. Hence in order to list or install packages from rOpenSci in R, you would use:

```r
# List available packages
available.packages(repos = "https://ropensci.r-universe.dev")

# Install a package
install.packages("magick", repos = "https://ropensci.r-universe.dev")
```
