title: "Search for packages"
---

You can search for packages via <https://r-universe.dev/search/> using keywords or author names.  
To search for an exact phrase like "weather data," use **double quotes** instead of single quotes.  
The search bar includes a drop-down button for accessing advanced search fields.

## How is the package-rank score calculated?

The exact algorithm is a work-in-progress and will change. 
At the time of writing it includes:

 - Number of dependents (that is to say, recursive reverse dependencies);
 - Number of stars on Github;
 - Number of unique contributors;
 - Commit activity over the last year;
 - Downloads per month from CRAN or Bioconductor mirrors;
 - Number of files on GitHub that mention 'library(pkgname)'.

You can explore [scores and metrics for all packages](https://r-universe.dev/packages).  
The algorithm will evolve as R-universe matures and better data becomes available.

## Why is a package sometimes listed twice?

If a source package fails to build (indicating a critical issue), a red "build failure" message is displayed.  
If a previous build succeeded, it remains available for users to install. 

## Which packages get included in search? {#deduplication}

In R-universe, a given R package can appear in multiple registries.
To avoid duplicates, search results only display packages from the upstream GitHub owner's universe, excluding third-party copies.

Specifically, search results include:

- Packages where the GitHub owner matches the universe name (e.g., packages under `https://jeroen.r-universe.dev` from `https://github.com/jeroen/`). This includes all CRAN packages.
- Packages where the universe name differs from the GitHub owner, but the DESCRIPTION file includes the full `user.r-universe.dev` URL in the `URL` field (e.g., `https://jeroen.r-universe.dev` or `https://jeroen.r-universe.dev/mypkg`).
