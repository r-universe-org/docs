    "text": "5.3 Package information\nThe initial section of the homepage shows descriptive data and links to resources from this package, such as source/binary files, the package manual and NEWS file. Further down we show installation instructions to install the package in R. Installation is quick and easy because we provide pre-compiled binaries for Windows and MacOS, so no special tools or setup is required on the user machine.\nHere you can also find more information derived by the build system, such as which system libraries the package builds on, topics, and if the package is on CRAN. The badges underneath show statistics about the package, such as dependencies, reverse dependencies, and GitHub stars. Clicking on the ’exports’ badge will show all functions and datasets exported by the package, which link to the respective sections in the manual page. If specified, we also show how the package should be cited in papers.\n\n5.3.1 How are the dependencies / dependents calculated?\nDependencies and dependents are derived using transitive (recursive) strong dependencies. Hence this includes both direct and indirect dependencies.\n\nDependencies: Other packages required to use the target package.\n\nDependents: Packages listing the target package as a dependency.\n\nAt package build time, we use tools::package_dependencies(pkg, recursive = TRUE) to compute the list of hard dependencies, excluding R-base packages. The size of this list determines the dependencies value, while the dependents value reflects the number of packages in R-universe depending on the target package.\n\n\n5.3.2 How does R-universe analyze system dependencies (C/C++)\nAfter the package has been installed, we use maketools to show external libraries that the package links to:\nmaketools::package_sysdeps(\"sf\")\n##                 shlib      package     headers source              version\n## 1   libproj.so.15.3.1    libproj15 libproj-dev   proj              6.3.1-1\n## 2   libgdal.so.26.0.4    libgdal26 libgdal-dev   gdal   3.0.4+dfsg-1build3\n## 3 libgeos_c.so.1.13.1 libgeos-c1v5 libgeos-dev   geos        3.8.0-1build1\n## 4 libstdc++.so.6.0.28   libstdc++6        &lt;NA&gt;    gcc 10-20200411-0ubuntu1\nIn a nutshell, maketools calls ldd on the installed R package to see which .so files are linked (the 1st column above). Then it uses the distro package manager (for instance dpkg) to query the runtime package deb that provides this file (the second column), and the corresponding headers and source packages. So to emphasize, this does not use heuristics / guessing based on the package description.\nThe maketools vignette explains this in more detail: Automatically determine run-time dependencies for R packages on Linux.",

    "section": "5.4 All the documentation",
    "text": "5.4 All the documentation\nR-universe renders and presents all available documentation to help you start using packages quickly.\n\n\n\nREADME of the sf package\n\n\n \nMost R packages have 3 forms of documentation: a README file, a reference manual (help pages), and a number of articles (including vignettes). These articles are often a good place to get started, and are listed on the package homepage right under the descriptives. From here you can view both the rendered html/pdf document, as well as the rmarkdown source file used to (re)produce the article.\nFurther down the page you can see the content from the package README. Most packages these days include a README.md file which can nicely be rendered into HTML.\nAfter the README follows a section named “reference manual” containing a table with all the help pages. These link to the respective chapters in the html reference manual, which provide the most extensive documentation for each function in the package, including descriptions, parameters, examples, etc.\n\n5.4.1 cran.dev shortlinks\nOn R-universe you can find package repositories from many different organizations and maintainers. But sometimes you just want to lookup a particular CRAN package, without knowing the developer. The cran.dev shortlink service lets you navigate or link directly to the R-universe homepage and docs of any established CRAN package.\nThe root domain https://cran.dev/{package} redirects to the primary homepage for a package:\n\nhttps://cran.dev/magick\nhttps://cran.dev/Matrix\nhttps://cran.dev/ggplot2\n\nThe subdomain https://docs.cran.dev/{package} redirects to package manual page:\n\nhttps://docs.cran.dev/targets\nhttps://docs.cran.dev/MASS\nhttps://docs.cran.dev/Rcpp\n\nFinally the subdomain https://api.cran.dev/{package} does not redirect, but returns a JSON blob with links to the package versions and resources. For example:\n\nhttps://api.cran.dev/gert\n\nThis shows the package page and maintainer for the gert package, and information on both the current CRAN release and development versions. Right now it returns:\n{\n  \"package\": \"gert\",\n  \"maintainer\": \"Jeroen Ooms &lt;jeroen@berkeley.edu&gt;\",\n  \"home\": \"https://ropensci.r-universe.dev/gert\",\n  \"release\": {\n    \"version\": \"1.9.2\",\n    \"date\": \"2023-06-30T08:43:26.000Z\",\n    \"source\": \"https://github.com/cran/gert\",\n    \"repository\": \"https://cloud.r-project.org\",\n    \"docs\": \"https://cran.r-universe.dev/gert/doc/manual.html\",\n    \"api\": \"https://cran.r-universe.dev/api/packages/gert\"\n  },\n  \"devel\": {\n    \"version\": \"1.9000\",\n    \"date\": \"2023-07-20T11:08:09.000Z\",\n    \"source\": \"https://github.com/r-lib/gert\",\n    \"repository\": \"https://ropensci.r-universe.dev\",\n    \"docs\": \"https://ropensci.r-universe.dev/gert/doc/manual.html\",\n    \"api\": \"https://ropensci.r-universe.dev/api/packages/gert\"\n  }\n}\nWe can see the release and devel version of this package, with links to the respective sources, cranlike repository, manual, and package metadata.\nFrom the above it can be seen that the gert R-universe page is https://ropensci.r-universe.dev/gert and the R-universe \"repository\" from where to install the devel version of gert:\n# install 'devel' gert\ninstall.packages(\"gert\", repos = \"https://ropensci.r-universe.dev\")\nThe \"api\" field shows the JSON url with all the information and metadata about this package:\n# Everything there is to know about devel gert\ngert &lt;- jsonlite::fromJSON('https://ropensci.r-universe.dev/api/packages/gert')\nNote that not all packages have a devel version available. CRAN packages that are not found on GitHub or GitLab or R-forge only have a release version, for example: https://api.cran.dev/MASS",

Supports RSA, DSA and EC curves P-256, P-384, P-521, and curve25519. Cryptographic signatures can either be created and verified manually or via x509 certificates. AES can be used in cbc, ctr or gcm mode for symmetric encryption; RSA for asymmetric (public key) encryption or EC for Diffie Hellman. High-level envelope functions combine RSA and AES for encrypting arbitrary sized data. Other utilities include key generators, hash functions (md5, sha1, sha256, etc), base64 encoder, a secure random number generator, and 'bignum' math methods for manually performing crypto calculations on large multibyte integers.&lt;/description&gt;\n  &lt;link&gt;https://github.com/r-universe/jeroen/actions/runs/11993712834&lt;/link&gt;\n  &lt;pubDate&gt;Fri, 25 Oct 2024 21:54:18 GMT&lt;/pubDate&gt;\n  &lt;r:package&gt;openssl&lt;/r:package&gt;\n  &lt;r:version&gt;2.2.2&lt;/r:version&gt;\n  &lt;r:status&gt;success&lt;/r:status&gt;\n  &lt;r:repository&gt;https://jeroen.r-universe.dev&lt;/r:repository&gt;\n  &lt;r:upstream&gt;https://github.com/jeroen/openssl&lt;/r:upstream&gt;\n  &lt;r:article&gt;\n    &lt;r:source&gt;crypto_hashing.Rmd&lt;/r:source&gt;\n    &lt;r:filename&gt;crypto_hashing.html&lt;/r:filename&gt;\n    &lt;r:title&gt;Cryptographic Hashing in R&lt;/r:title&gt;\n    &lt;r:created&gt;2015-01-07 04:08:07&lt;/r:created&gt;\n    &lt;r:modified&gt;2024-08-16 09:18:11&lt;/r:modified&gt;\n  &lt;/r:article&gt;\n  &lt;r:article&gt;\n    &lt;r:source&gt;bignum.Rmd&lt;/r:source&gt;\n    &lt;r:filename&gt;bignum.html&lt;/r:filename&gt;\n    &lt;r:title&gt;Fun with bignum: how RSA encryption works&lt;/r:title&gt;\n    &lt;r:created&gt;2015-11-24 12:00:10&lt;/r:created&gt;\n    &lt;r:modified&gt;2020-06-01 10:12:29&lt;/r:modified&gt;\n  &lt;/r:article&gt;\n  &lt;r:article&gt;\n    &lt;r:source&gt;secure_rng.Rmd&lt;/r:source&gt;\n    &lt;r:filename&gt;secure_rng.html&lt;/r:filename&gt;\n    &lt;r:title&gt;Generating Secure Random Numbers in R&lt;/r:title&gt;\n    &lt;r:created&gt;2015-01-07 04:08:07&lt;/r:created&gt;\n    &lt;r:modified&gt;2024-08-16 09:18:11&lt;/r:modified&gt;\n  &lt;/r:article&gt;\n  &lt;r:article&gt;\n    &lt;r:source&gt;keys.Rmd&lt;/r:source&gt;\n    &lt;r:filename&gt;keys.html&lt;/r:filename&gt;\n    &lt;r:title&gt;Importing and exporting RSA/DSA/EC keys&lt;/r:title&gt;\n    &lt;r:created&gt;2016-05-25 10:42:58&lt;/r:created&gt;\n    &lt;r:modified&gt;2016-10-26 19:55:55&lt;/r:modified&gt;\n  &lt;/r:article&gt;\n&lt;/item&gt;\n&lt;item&gt;\n  &lt;title&gt;[ropensci] universe 1.0.0&lt;/title&gt;\n  &lt;author&gt;jeroenooms@gmail.com (Jeroen Ooms)&lt;/author&gt;\n  &lt;description&gt;Utilities to interact with the R-universe platform.

By default, the endpoint returns a zip file with all the repository’s packages, binaries, and documentation. If needed, you can filter the content to include only specific binaries, R versions, or subsets of packages.\nExplore the API parameters for your universe, for instance https://ggseg.r-universe.dev/api.\n\n\n9.2.3 Using snapshots\nA CRAN-like R package repository is essentially a static directory of package files and indexes, with a specific naming structure. R-universe automatically builds and updates all these files based on a registry of packages and upstream git sources. Once everything is generated, you can simply copy the entire folder elsewhere, and have a frozen CRAN-like package repository on that server. For instance…\n\nAn organization could host a mirror of their repository internally in their intranet. They could update the mirror every day, every month, etc.\nYou could create a GitHub Action which regularly downloads a snapshot from R-universe to publish on github-pages. Here is a minimal example of such an action: https://github.com/jeroen/backup.\n\nNote how the aforementioned action is very fast: downloading and extracting the snapshot from R-universe only takes a few seconds. So this is easily something that could be done on demand, or automatically on a regular basis.\nYou can also install packages in R directly from a local snapshot folder, by prefixing the path that you pass to install.packages with file:// (Windows paths need to be normalized to look more unixy):\n# Download and extract the snapshot\ncurl::curl_download(\"https://jeroen.r-universe.dev/api/snapshot/zip?binaries=4.3\", \"snapshot.zip\")\nsnapshot &lt;- file.path(tempdir(), 'jeroen')\nunzip(\"snapshot.zip\", exdir = snapshot)\n\n# Install packages from the local repository\nprefix &lt;- ifelse (.Platform$OS.type == \"windows\", \"file:///\", \"file://\")\nrepos &lt;- paste0(prefix, normalizePath(snapshot, \"/\"))\ninstall.packages(c(\"V8\", \"mongolite\"), repos = repos)",

    "text": "11.3 Populating the packages.json registry file\nIn order to publish content on R-universe, you need to create a registry file called packages.json, which lists the Git urls containing the R packages you want to include in your universe. The file is formatted as a JSON array with required fields package and url for each entry, for example:\n[\n    {\n        \"package\": \"curl\",\n        \"url\": \"https://github.com/jeroen/curl\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"package\": \"pdftools\",\n        \"url\": \"https://github.com/ropensci/pdftools\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"package\": \"stringdist\",\n        \"url\": \"https://github.com/markvanderloo/stringdist\",\n        \"subdir\": \"pkg\"\n    }\n]\n\n11.3.1 Special case of CRAN packages\nWhen browsing the R-universe homepage you may notice that some major universes that contain many CRAN packages do not have a packages.json registry: When the R-universe app is installed on a GitHub account that does not have a proper packages.json file, the build system automatically starts adding all packages from CRAN which are owned by that particular GitHub account. Ownership is determined by the presence of a link to a GitHub repository in the URL or BugReports field of a CRAN package. Our scraper scans all CRAN packages for GitHub links on a daily basis and stores results in the cran-to-git database.\nThese are effectively auto-generated registries, on which the build system will fall back if the user does not have a personal registry. As soon as the user creates a proper universe registry repository with the packages.json file, this will take precedence, and the build system will automatically switch over.\n\n11.3.1.1 How to prevent a CRAN/BioConductor package from automatically being indexed by R-universe\nCRAN and BioConductor packages with a valid Git URL in the description are automatically indexed by R-universe. To prevent this, add a line to the package DESCRIPTION file with: Config/runiverse/noindex: true (Config/ field names are allowed on CRAN). The R-universe scraper runs once per day, so it can take up to 24 hours for the package to be removed from R-universe.\n\n\n\n11.3.2 Tracking custom branches or releases\nBy default, R-universe tracks and builds the default branch for each package Git repository, for instance master or main. It is possible to customize which Git branch or tag to track by adding a branch field to the registry.\nThe branch field can take the name of any Git reference (either a branch or a tag). You can also set it to a special value \"*release\" which will automatically lookup the most recent GitHub release, using the same syntax as in remotes. For example:\n[\n  {\n    \"package\" : \"somepackage\",\n    \"url\" : \"https://github.com/jeroen/somepackage\",\n    \"branch\" : \"stable\"\n  }\n  {\n    \"package\": \"jose\",\n    \"url\": \"https://github.com/jeroen/jose\",\n    \"branch\" : \"*release\"\n  }\n]\nIf you want to use the default Git branch, it is safest to omit the branch field. This way everything will keep working, even if the default branch gets another name at some point in the future.\n\n\n11.3.3 Hand-written or programmatically created\nYou can either hand-write this packages.json file, or programmatically create it using the tools of your choice. For example you can generate it in R from a data frame using jsonlite:\ndf &lt;- data.frame(\n    package = c(\"curl\", \"pdftools\", \"stringdist\"),\n    url = c(\"https://github.com/jeroen/curl\", \"https://github.com/ropensci/pdftools\", \n        \"https://github.com/markvanderloo/stringdist\"),\n    subdir = c(NA, NA, \"pkg\")\n)\njsonlite::write_json(df, 'packages.json', pretty = TRUE)\nThe url value must be a public Git url. This is important; our build servers literally call git clone ${url} on each of the entries. The package field must match the name of the R package from the DESCRIPTION file under that url. If the R package does not live in the root of the Git repository, you also need to set the subdir field to the path of the R package root directory.\nWhen creating a new universe, start by adding no more than a few packages. You can easily add more packages later by updating your packages.json file.\nTo publish your registry, create a Git repository called &lt;yourname&gt;.r-universe.dev on your GitHub account and push your packages.json file. See for example: https://github.com/maelle/maelle.r-universe.dev.",

So the package may automatically get updated to the CRAN version on the end-user machine.",
