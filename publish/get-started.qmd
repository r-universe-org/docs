title: "Why publish on R-universe"
---

## Put your packages (and yourself) on the map

By registering your packages with R-universe, you make your packages easier to [find and assess by users](/browse/get-started.html).

Creating your own, or your own organization's, R-universe creates a showcase of expertise and interests.

## Make your packages easy to install

R-universe build binaries TODO add details

## More inspiration

Read or watch interviews of the series [Meeting the stars of the R-Universe](https://ropensci.org/blog/2023/11/06/r-universe-stars-finale/), that are examples of organizations and teams that choose R-Universe to facilitate access and promote community sharing of data and software.

## It is free!

R-universe is provided free of charge.

## Only a few steps for set-up!

See the [set-up docs](/publish/set-up.html).

## It is not incompatible with CRAN

You can choose to publish your package on both CRAN (official releases) 
and R-universe (more continuous deployment),
or to forego CRAN, and only rely on your organization's R-universe.

CRAN is not meant to be the only CRAN-style package repository, as [explained by CRAN co-founder Kurt Hornik in his useR! 2024 keynote](https://static.sched.com/hosted_files/userconf2024/41/user2024_CRAN.pdf#page=8).
