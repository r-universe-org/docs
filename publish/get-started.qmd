## It is free!

# Relation to other networks

Packages on R-universe may also also exist on other networks, such as CRAN or BioConductor.

Note that CRAN is not meant to be the only CRAN-style package repository, as [explained by CRAN co-founder Kurt Hornik in his useR! 2024 keynote](https://static.sched.com/hosted_files/userconf2024/41/user2024_CRAN.pdf#page=8).
