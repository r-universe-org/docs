## Relation to other networks

Packages on R-universe may also also exist on other networks, such as CRAN or BioConductor.

Note that CRAN is not meant to be the only CRAN-style package repository, as [explained by CRAN co-founder Kurt Hornik in his useR! 2024 keynote](https://static.sched.com/hosted_files/userconf2024/41/user2024_CRAN.pdf#page=8).

## Can we use r-universe to host older versions of CRAN packages?

This is possible, but be careful that it may not work as you expect. 
R's `install.packages()` and `update.packages()` will always install the latest version of a package it can find in any of the available repos. 
So the package may automatically get updated to the CRAN version on the end-user machine.

## Can we use r-universe to host a fork of a CRAN package?

This is possible but generally a bad idea. 
Your package may automatically get overwritten by the CRAN version of the package the next time the user runs `install.packages()` or `update.packages()`. 
Also note that other packages may depend on this package, and might not be compatible with your fork.
