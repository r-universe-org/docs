title: "Set up your own universe"
---

## Basic steps

Setting up a universe for your R packages involves just a few steps, outlined below. 
Additional details for each step are provided in the sections that follow.

1. **Create a Git repository named (all lowercase) `<your-username>.r-universe.dev` on your GitHub account**, containing a `packages.json` file which lists the Git repositories with R packages to include. 
    - For an organization at `github.com/ropensci` the repository is thus `github.com/ropensci/ropensci.r-universe.dev`; 
    - similarly for an user at `github.com/jeroen` the repository is `github.com/jeroen/jeroen.r-universe.dev`.
  [More details](#subdomain).
1. **Install the [r-universe app](https://github.com/apps/r-universe/installations/new) on this same GitHub account** or organization for which you want to create the universe. Clicking on the [app link](https://github.com/apps/r-universe/installations/new) will lead you to a page that asks "Where do you want to install R-universe?". [More details](#appinstall).
1. **Wait** for your packages to start appearing on `https://<yourname>.r-universe.dev` once they have finished building. [More details](#wait-first-build).
1. **Document** how to install packages from R-universe in the docs of your packages. [More details](#document-install).

## Creating your personal R-universe subdomain {#subdomain}

Each user gets a private subdomain on R-universe, where you control the content independently. 
Subdomains are tied to GitHub accounts or organizations with the same name.

### Case-sensitivity

Domain names are by definition case-insensitive and lowercased.

### How much GitHub is compulsory?

You need a GitHub account to host the repository for your `packages.json` registry.
However, **the R packages themselves do not need to be under the same account or even on GitHub**. 
They can be hosted on **any public Git server**, such as GitLab or a university Git server.
A GitHub account is only required for publishing the `packages.json` registry.

## Populating the packages.json registry file

In order to publish content on R-universe, you need to create a registry file called [packages.json](https://github.com/maelle/maelle.r-universe.dev/blob/main/packages.json), which lists the Git urls containing the R packages you want to include in your universe. The file is formatted as a JSON array with required fields `package` and `url` for each entry, for example:

```json
[
    {
        "package": "curl",
        "url": "https://github.com/jeroen/curl"
    },
    {
        "package": "pdftools",
        "url": "https://github.com/ropensci/pdftools"
    },
    {
        "package": "stringdist",
        "url": "https://github.com/markvanderloo/stringdist",
        "subdir": "pkg"
    }
]
```

### Special case of CRAN packages

When browsing the [R-universe homepage](https://r-universe.dev/) you may notice that some major universes that contain many CRAN packages do not have a `packages.json` registry:
When the R-universe app is installed on a GitHub account that does not have a proper packages.json file, the build system automatically starts adding all packages from CRAN which are owned by that particular GitHub account.
Ownership is determined by the presence of a link to a GitHub repository in the `URL` or `BugReports` field of a CRAN package. 
Our scraper scans all CRAN packages for GitHub links on a daily basis and stores results in the [cran-to-git](https://github.com/r-universe-org/cran-to-git) database.

These are effectively auto-generated registries, on which the build system will fall back if the user does not have a personal registry. 
As soon as the user creates a proper `universe` registry repository with the `packages.json` file, this will take precedence, and the build system will automatically switch over.


#### How to prevent a CRAN/BioConductor package from automatically being indexed by R-universe

CRAN and BioConductor packages with a valid Git URL in the description are automatically indexed by R-universe. To prevent this, add a line to the package DESCRIPTION file with: `Config/runiverse/noindex: true` (Config/ field names are allowed on CRAN). The R-universe scraper runs once per day, so it can take up to 24 hours for the package to be removed from R-universe.


### Tracking custom branches or releases

By default, R-universe tracks and builds the default branch for each package Git repository, for instance `master` or `main`. 
It is possible to customize which Git branch or tag to track by adding a `branch` field to the registry.

The `branch` field can take the name of any Git reference (either a branch or a tag). 
You can also set it to a special value `"*release"` which will automatically lookup the most recent GitHub release, using [the same syntax](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/remotes/vignettes/dependencies.html) as in remotes. 
For example:

```json
[
  {
    "package" : "somepackage",
    "url" : "https://github.com/jeroen/somepackage",
    "branch" : "stable"
  }
  {
    "package": "jose",
    "url": "https://github.com/jeroen/jose",
    "branch" : "*release"
  }
]
```

If you want to use the default Git branch, it is safest to omit the `branch` field. 
This way everything will keep working, even if the default branch gets another name at some point in the future.


### Hand-written or programmatically created

You can either hand-write this `packages.json` file, or programmatically create it using the tools of your choice. 
For example you can generate it in R from a data frame using [jsonlite](https://jeroen.r-universe.dev/jsonlite):

```r
df <- data.frame(
    package = c("curl", "pdftools", "stringdist"),
    url = c("https://github.com/jeroen/curl", "https://github.com/ropensci/pdftools", 
        "https://github.com/markvanderloo/stringdist"),
    subdir = c(NA, NA, "pkg")
)
jsonlite::write_json(df, 'packages.json', pretty = TRUE)
```

The `url` value __must be a public Git url__. 
This is important; our build servers literally call `git clone ${url}` on each of the entries. 
The `package` field must match the name of the R package from the DESCRIPTION file under that url.
If the R package does not live in the root of the Git repository, you also need to set the `subdir` field to the path of the R package root directory.

When creating a new universe, start by adding no more than a few packages. 
You can easily add more packages later by updating your `packages.json` file.

To publish your registry, create a Git repository called `<yourname>.r-universe.dev` on your GitHub account and push your `packages.json` file. See for example: https://github.com/maelle/maelle.r-universe.dev.

## Installing the GitHub app {#appinstall}

Once you pushed your `packages.json` file to your new `universe` repository on GitHub, the next step is to install the [R-universe GitHub app](https://github.com/apps/r-universe/installations/new) on your account.

The _"Read and write access to commit statuses"_ will enable R-universe to show commit status updates (green checkmark) to the repositories of your R packages if they are hosted under that GitHub account.

We recommend to install the app for "All repositories" as you might later add more packages to your universe.

## Waiting for the first build {#wait-first-build}

Once you installed the app, the system will automatically create your personal monorepo under the R-universe organization: `https://github.com/r-universe/<yourname>`. 
This is where the system keeps the full history of your packages.
The [actions tab of your monorepo](https://github.com/r-universe/maelle/actions) is also where the building happens.

[![](https://jeroen.github.io/runiverse2021/images/actions.png){fig-alt="Screenshot of the actions tab of the r-universe/maelle repository"}](https://github.com/r-universe/maelle/actions)

After a while (usually no more than one hour), packages and articles that have completed building on all platforms will start appearing on your dashboard, and directly become available for installation by users.

The GitHub app requires very limited permissions, it only requests permission to *read and write commit statuses*. This means that the R-universe build system can post a green checkmark on your package Git commits, once your package is successfully built and deployed to R-universe. Thereby R-universe serves as a full CI-CD system that shows you if your package build and deploy was successful.

[![](https://jeroen.github.io/runiverse2021/images/commitstatus.png){fig-alt="Screenshot of a GitHub repository demonstrating that clicking on the green icon on the latest commit indicates the successful build of the package for R-universe."}](https://jeroen.github.io/runiverse2021/#54)

## Adding badges and user instructions {#document-install}

Once your packages have appeared on the dashboard, try installing them in R using the instructions from the dashboard page, for example:

```r
# Enable this universe
options(repos = c(
    maelle = 'https://maelle.r-universe.dev',
    CRAN = 'https://cloud.r-project.org'))

# Install some packages
install.packages('tinkr')
```

Copy these instructions to your package `README.md` files to assist users. You can also add an R-universe badge to indicate the deployed version:

The badge API is simply `/badges/<package>` which will yield an SVG image that can directly be embedded into your markdown files, showing the deployed version for the given package:

```md
![r-universe](https://r-lib.r-universe.dev/badges/cpp11)
```

For example this would produce the following badge: <img style="margin-bottom:3px;" src="https://r-lib.r-universe.dev/badges/cpp11"></img>


## Linking to your universe from other websites

Feel free to add a link to your universe from your other online profile (website, social media, GitHub profile README, etc.).
You can use a rocket icon as icon.
