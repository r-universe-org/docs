title: "Using dependencies from R-universe"

## Can a CRAN package take on a dependency from R-universe?

Yes! It has to be an optional dependency (`Suggests`) and you need to

- List the R-universe in the `Additional_repositories` field in `DESCRIPTION`. [Examples of CRAN packages doing so](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Acran+path%3ADESCRIPTION+additional_repositories%3A+r-universe.dev&type=code). The field will *not* ensure installation of the package. Its sole purpose is allowing CRAN to check the package is indeed available in that other repository.

- Alternatively, if you are ok getting a NOTE from R CMD check (that you can explain in cran-comments.md) list the URL where to install the package somewhere else in `DESCRIPTION` ([example](https://github.com/cran/prioritizr/blob/0738fe58f55c812a3023e81398d4294487a8c497/DESCRIPTION#L21)).

- Document, for the user, how to install the missing package. You can do that 
    - In user-facing documentation (README, package-level manual page, manual page of the functions that use the dependency). [Example](https://github.com/ropensci/usaboundaries?tab=readme-ov-file#installation).
    - Within the code, for instance:
    
```r
if (!(require("targets")) {
  stop("You can install targets with install.packages('targets', repos = c('https://ropensci.r-universe.dev', 'https://cloud.r-project.org'))")
}

```

or a solution that will automatically prompt the user to install the missing package:
    
```r
rlang::check_installed("targets", action = function(...) install.packages('targets', repos = c('https://ropensci.r-universe.dev', 'https://cloud.r-project.org')))
```

## How to use a universe on regular continous integration?

If you want to test a package against versions of other packages that are in a universe, on GitHub Actions you can use the [`extra-repositories` field of the `r-lib/actions` setup-r action](https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v2-branch/setup-r#inputs).
